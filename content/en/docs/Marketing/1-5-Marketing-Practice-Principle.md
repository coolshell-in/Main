If an enterprise does not have a professional **Brand-Media-Marketing (BMM)** department, nor has it commissioned an agency for design and implementation, in the initial stage, based on the basic concepts of the **BMM** system framework, the founding team will need to accumulate **BMM** materials on their own. The complete questionnaire has over 100 questions, but you should at least be able to answer the questions in this chapter - the four core principle-based questions.

# 4 Core Implementation Principles: Core Questionnaire of CI & Marketing Practice Principle

## Differentiation

**Description:** In a competitive market, brands need to have a clear point of differentiation or reason for being. What they stand for needs to be distinct from others in order to attract attention, make a lasting impression, and ultimately become the preferred choice.

**Questions:** Are there competitors? What are the differences from competitors? Does it fill a gap in the market? Does it improve efficiency? Does it save money?

## Relevance

**Description:** Brands need to connect with what people care about. In order to build demand, they need to understand and address the needs and desires of their target audience.

**Questions:** Does it engage as many stakeholders as possible? Can it be associated with different industries (Environment, Aircraft, Ship, Agriculture, Biology, Food, etc.)? Can it become infrastructure like water, electricity, and roads?

## Coherence

**Description:** To ensure credibility with their audience, brands must practice what they preach. All messaging, all marketing communications, all brand experiences, and all product delivery need to tie together and be meaningfully coherent.

**Questions:** How to build credibility? How to stay true to your word in a complex market environment? What are the user agreements and terms?

## Esteem

**Description:** Brands that are differentiated, relevant, and coherent are brands that are esteemed by their internal and external audiences. Esteem is the reputation a brand earns by demonstrably delivering on its promises and experiences.

**Questions:** How to gain reputation and respect? What is the Corporate Social Responsibility?

**Others:**

1. Has a corporate identity (CI) system been established? Who is the original CI designer? Where are the CI documents?
2. In order to register for media accounts and other services, please provide a company domain email address, for example: [marketing@megaease.com](mailto:marketing@megaease.com)
