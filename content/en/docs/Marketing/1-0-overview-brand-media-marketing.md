# Concepts Definition

**Brand, Advertising, Media, Communication, Public Relations, Publicity, Culture, Market, Sales, Marketing**

There are many concepts related to the above, which are often confused by practitioners in the industry. This confusion makes it easier to deceive laymen and the innocent or ignorant public for illegal profits.

To clarify, we searched for reliable information from modern Western business subjects to define the connotation, denotation, structure, and framework of these concepts.

From this point forward, ordinary people can start from scratch and quickly engage in regular marketing and sales. All related activities are collectively referred to as "marketing" as a concept here.


## Brand

A brand is a name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that defines a business's image, establishing a "personality" for the company, product, or service in the minds of consumers.

That feature also identifies one seller's product or service as distinct from those of other sellers.

[Wiki: Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brand)

[Mckinsey Branding](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/how-we-help-clients/branding)

All activities related to **corporate identity** are collectively referred to as branding, primarily focusing on the design of abstract concepts that exist solely on paper.

Brand creation strategy encompasses the overall goals of advertising, marketing, and public relations, aiming to communicate with consumers, inform them about the value of goods, and encourage purchases, among other things.

Branding emphasizes the creation of an image related to goods, services, and the consumer base, then leveraging these factors in conjunction with marketing, advertising, and public relations. The role of branding is to shape the future prospects of the consumer base or the enterprise. It goes beyond just trademarks, slogans, and colors, and also utilizes the company's recognition. For example, customer service plays a vital role in brand promotion.

Branding involves predicting and positioning for the future landscape. Brand work requires accurate predictions about future industry trends and patterns, and making the most appropriate and advantageous market positioning for the brand. Brand work also requires defining the competitive framework, clarifying the current competitive framework of the category and the desired future competitive framework, and finding ways to upgrade the competitive framework.

**Branding requires mind positioning and setting brand associations.**

What position the brand will occupy in the minds of consumers, and what the key associations are, whether sensory associations, linguistic associations, or contextual associations.


## Means of communication

The information carrier between the communicator and the receiver in the process of **information dissemination**, and all communication channels and tools for storing and transmitting information or data.

[Wiki: Media(communication)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_communication)

The more concrete **cultural publicity content and materials** of the brand are extended online and offline, connecting the upstream brand and downstream marketing.

Most people use Media (noun) to replace the concept of Media of communication (verb + noun). We will strictly distinguish the differences in the scope of responsibility and nature of the two. Here, media (content) is only a subset of media of communication. For the convenience of readers' understanding, media may still be used in many places to refer to the concept of media of communication.


### Media (Content)

The media defined here does not include the act of dissemination, but only refers to the media content, which is explained in detail in the above media of communication.

[Internet media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)

From the perspective of file format and dimension, it can be divided into:
- One-dimensional: text (article)
- Two-dimensional: pictures, audio, video (multimedia)
- Three-dimensional: audio-visual, animation, games, etc.

Official media: books, newspapers, magazines, television, movies

Self-media: personal social media



### Advertising

Advertising is a marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, non-personal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea.

[Wiki: Advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising)

Advertising is paid media publicity (Paid Media), a publicity opportunity to increase visibility. Advertising is a simple visual embodiment of brand planning. The purpose of advertising is to promote the brand to specific consumer groups.

Advertising focuses on the content you provide, while marketing focuses on the content customers need. The difference between the two is the focus.


### Communication

Communication (from Latin communicare , meaning "to share" or "to be in relation with") is "an apparent answer to the painful divisions between self and other, private and public, and inner thought and outer world.‚Äù

[Wiki: Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication)

[Communication](https://www.etymonline.com/word/communication)


### PR- Public Relationship

It is the management and dissemination of information from individuals or organizations (such as businesses, government agencies, or non-profit organizations) to influence public perception. It uses various information dissemination methods to conduct two-way communication with its internal and external publics, establish mutual understanding and dependence between the organization and the public, and build a good organizational image.

[Wiki: Public_relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations)

Public relations is a kind of **Earned Media exposure**. One of the main functions of public relations is to spread the brand through media communication to gain public attention and awareness of the company, products or services.

Public relations is a creative and strategic publicity activity aimed at supporting the brand communication of products, services or consumer groups.

Public relations mainly faces media relations. Its main goal is to promote its products to the media, and then let consumers generate awareness through a large number of media channels. This process is B2B2C.


## Marketing


Common media combines the four words of marketing into one concept. Here, for a clearer and more precise definition, we will use marketing as a general term, and the market is one of its subsets.

Marketing is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of a target market in terms of goods and services.

[Wiki: Marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing)

All economic activities related to **market and sales** are collectively referred to as marketing, mainly about the promotion of goods and services. The market is about how to plan to expand the brand.

<aside>
‚úçüèº Note: When writing the marketing framework, I found a special phenomenon that questionnaires are hardly used to ask questions. A large number of automated tools and AI have emerged, and there are fewer and fewer manual operations. From the perspective of part of speech, there are more verbs, while brands and media have more nouns. In other words, the work in the market sales stage is to execute precise actions.
</aside>

Marketing is a process and strategy about how to solve customer needs and deliver customer needs through various channels.

The goal of marketing is to influence consumers to take action, which may influence consumers to buy goods, change purchase intentions, or change lifestyles.

Marketing includes the functions of media, as well as other aspects, such as public relations, advertising, events, sponsorship, exhibitions, product promotion, search engine marketing or search engine optimization, etc.

### Operation

[Wiki: Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation)

Also called operation (Taiwan version), it belongs to verbs, and refers to the specific daily business management and other behaviors and actions that connect all related marketing activities.


### Market

The definition here refers to the market in a narrow sense (economic concept), which is limited to the place or scene of trading and consumption.

[Market (broad concept)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market)

[Market (economic concept)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics))

Many people or companies may confuse the concepts of market and marketing. In fact, the "market department" of all companies should be renamed "marketing department".

### Sales

All activities that lead to the sale of goods and services. Work directly with potential customers to reinforce the value of the company's solutions and convert potential customers into direct customers.

# The relationship among Branding, Media of communication and Marketing

Branding, media of communication, and marketing have different functions and must be implemented by relevant professionals, coordinated and used jointly to achieve the overall goal.

|  |  | Part of Speech | Scope | Target Audience | Metaphor | Cycle |  | Main Tasks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upstream (Core) | **Branding** | Noun | Corporate Identity | Everyone: employees, customers, potential audience | Goal, strategy, framework, spirit, operating system | Eternal and long-term, long-term investment, slow to take effect | Abstract concept, purely paper-based work | Design brand, formulate strategies, mental positioning, shape identity |
| Midstream (Middle Layer) | **Media of communication** | Noun-Verb | Media, Advertising, Public Relations | Customers, potential audience | Process, skills, flesh and blood, body, physical hardware | Continuous operation | Concrete physical medium | Execute strategies, gain public attention and awareness |
| Downstream (Periphery) | **Marketing** | Verb | Market, Sales | Customers | Strategy, tactics, makeup, behavior, application software | Fast-changing, temporary and short-term, short-term operation, quick to take effect | Behavioral activities | Implement strategies, promote goods and services, expand brand |

## Metaphorical explanation

**Strategy** achieves **goals** through **strength**


### Analogy with war

- Brand is the **goal**


- Media of communication is **strength**, which is military force, specifically including dissemination and media

Dissemination is **action**, which is a specific military action and behavior;

Media is the **weapon**, which is the content (material, hard shell, firepower) and more advanced (spiritual thought, soft shell) triggered by the dissemination


- Marketing is the **strategy**, which is the macro strategy, specifically including advertising and public relations

Advertising and public relations belong to **skills**, which are specific tactics


### Analogy with the human body

Brand is the skeleton, media of communication is the flesh, and marketing is the makeup

Brand is the spirit, media of communication is the body, and marketing is the behavior


### Analogy with computer

Brand is the operating system, media of communication is the physical hardware, and marketing is the application software


### Other metaphors

Brand is a long-term investment, marketing is a short-term operation, and brand is the basis of marketing

Marketing can be a great way to get a customer‚Äôs attention, but branding is a great way to keep their attention.

Marketing drives sales, branding drives awareness and loyalty

Brand first, marketing second

Brand is eternal and long-lasting, marketing strategy is short-acting and changes rapidly

Brand is a marathon, marketing is a sprint


## **Different target audiences**

Branding has as much impact on your team as it does on your customers (brand penetration affects everyone, but media and marketing can only affect customers)

Brand: For everyone (employees, customers, potential audience);

Media of communication: For customers, potential audience;

Marketing: For customers;

- Branding is the process of strategically shaping the public's perception of your business and any products you sell.
- Marketing is the process of understanding your target customers through market research, understanding their problems, and showing them how your products can help them solve one or more of them.
- Advertising is a marketing strategy that requires you to pay a third party to display ads for your business for a period of time.
- If you're just starting to build a business, start with branding. Your brand is at the heart of everything you do as a business. It will directly affect how and why you market and advertise.
