[Wiki: CI Corporate Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_identity)


# Business and target audience

**The first step to delivering appropriate quality CI design work is to get to know everything about the client’s business and industry.**

## **Background Story**

Brands are driven by storytelling, Think of yourself like a Hollywood director tasked with remaking a classic movie: You need to get familiar with the original before you can put your own spin on it.

why did you start up the company/Organization? please describe the interesting process.

## **Founder’s Core Team**

Who are you? what’s your brief introduction with Resume of Linked, Blog, Social media, etc.

## **Product/services**

**positioning statement**

What products or services do you offer?
What are some of its values?
Summarize what your company does in one or two sentences. This is like your company mission statement, only more specific to your offerings. Here’s Volvo’s for an example:

> “For upscale American families, Volvo is the family automobile that offers maximum safety.”

**The benefit of your product/service**
- How exactly are you helping your target audiences?
- What sets your business apart?
- What is your main appeal?
- Does it save your customers money?
- Does it help them increase ROI or work efficiency?
- How do you solve your customers’ problems?
- Why clients should buy your product or services?
- Why should your target audience choose your product or service above your competitors?

## Culture

What Are Your Company’s core Principles, or the statement of mission, vision and value?

- Vision

## **Audiences**

Who are your target and prospective audience/Users/Clients/Customers?

Are there any audiences you aren't currently reaching that you want to reach with your brand?

What are your ideal customers' biggest pain points? what do they want?
Audience Profiles/ User Portrait: age, gender, location, lifestyle, profession, interest, income, etc.

# Brand Personality Attributes

**A brand is an organization’s personality that needs to come across in all its marketing initiatives. We have to get a deeper understanding of the brand to best represent it.**

**4 elements of CI**

- Logo
- Typeface
- Imagery
- Style guidelines

[Designed for success: 4 elements of a corporate identity package](https://www.templafy.com/blog/designing-for-success-4-elements-of-corporate-identity/)

Mainly Elements:

- Brand name
- Logo
- Slogan
- Standard color
- typeface
- Design style guide

## **Brand name**

The basic principles of a good name

1. harmonious in English and Chinese: including the domain name of the website, the Chinese name, the English name, or the language name of its target customer area.
2. convey the meaning: the name can indicate the meaning of the company's main business or products, is not out of the ordinary, is easy to remember and easy to spread.
3. sufficiently concise: the number of brand names < 5 Chinese characters / English is a scarce resource and there will be an increasing scarcity of brand names that are as short as possible.
4. unified name: brand names include, company name, trademark name, online shop name, web name, website domain name, self-publishing name, as unified as possible; there can be more than one set of brand names, and they are not consistent with the company name.

eg. engaged in biotechnology, take the name ××× 博泰（pinyin: botai） ×××biotech

## **Slogan**

Requirements: Number of brand names ＜Word count of tagline ＜15 Chinese characters / English

The tagline or catchphrase is a sub-title of the brand name and can be designed to be used in a variety of media materials.

eg. Examples of commercial taglines

Nike: Just Do lt!

Mac Donald: I'm lovin' it.

KFC: Finger licken'good

Adidas: Nothing is Impossible

Apple: Think Different
